# R2RML mappings repository

This repository contains the R2RML mapping files custom created the proTRAIT postgres staging database to transform EHR data into RDF and a more FAIR format.  

The Master branch contains mappings that are tested and validated and in active use by the FAIRifier pipeline in the proTRAIT project.  
The R2RML mappings that are still under development are stored in the Development branch.
