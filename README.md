# Mapping Unifications

This repository contains the files for the proTRAIT postgres staging database. The mappings are categorised according 
to the item lists found on protrait.nl e.g. genericList2 headAndNeck etc. If the files are in a NotValidated subfolder
no triples have been generated with the mapping. 

The Test_ModularTurtleFiles folder contains experimental r2rml files to test whether we can automatically create sparql 
code and more easily reuse the files for other projects.
